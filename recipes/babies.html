        <h2>What Are They??</h2>
        <p>Probably the greatest treat your greasy fists will ever clutch. Here's what you'll need.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>sausage</li>
            <li>bread</li>
            <li>apple</li>
            <li>cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to make it right!</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut up them apples into dice-sized cubes. Put them in a pot with some water and sugar and start boiling.</li>
            <li>Fry up the sausage in burger-sized patties.</li>
            <li>In the remaining sausage grease, fry two sliced of bread with some cheese on one of them. Once cooked to light golden crispiness, put them together as a grilled cheese sandwich.</li>
            <li>Hopefully by this point the apples are soft because its time to put it all together. Put the sandwich on a plate, put the cooked sausage patty on top, then a big scoop of apples on top of that.</li>
            <li>Guess what? It's time to eat that thing. It's called a baby makes you feel warm and safe like a baby.</li>
        </ol>
