        <h2>What Even Is It??</h2>
        <p>Cereal is the original food. Scholars suspect that it is indeed the "mana" that YHWH issued to the masses in old times. That's why it tastes so good.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>cereal</li>
            <li>milk</li>
            <li>a passion to serve others</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to make it good and true!</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Get that bowl out and put the cereal and milk in it. Go to town my one true king.</li>
